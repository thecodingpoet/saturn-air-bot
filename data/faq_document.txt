BOOKING AND RESERVATIONS

How to Book a Flight
You can book flights through multiple channels: our official website at www.saturnairlines.com, our mobile app (available for iOS and Android), by calling our reservations center at 1-800-SATURN-1 (1-800-728-8761), or through authorized travel agents. Online bookings are available 24/7, while our call center operates from 5:00 AM to 11:00 PM Pacific Time, seven days a week. When booking online, you can search for flights by destination, date, and number of passengers. Our booking system allows you to compare prices across different fare classes and select seats during the booking process.

Fare Types and Classes
Saturn Airlines offers three main fare classes: Economy, Premium Economy, and Business Class. Within Economy, we have Basic Economy (non-refundable, no seat selection, no changes), Standard Economy (allows seat selection and changes for a fee), and Flex Economy (fully refundable with free changes). Premium Economy provides extra legroom, priority boarding, and enhanced meal service. Business Class features lie-flat seats on select routes, premium dining, and access to airport lounges. All fares include one personal item and one carry-on bag, with checked baggage available for purchase.

Payment Methods and Options
We accept all major credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover), debit cards, PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and bank transfers for bookings made at least 14 days in advance. For international bookings, we also accept wire transfers. Payment plans are available for bookings over $500 through our partnership with Affirm, allowing you to pay in installments. All prices are displayed in USD, and currency conversion is handled automatically for international payment methods.

Group Bookings
For groups of 10 or more passengers traveling together, we offer special group rates and flexible payment terms. Group bookings must be made at least 30 days in advance and require a deposit of 25% at the time of booking, with full payment due 14 days before departure. Group coordinators receive dedicated support and can make changes to individual passenger names up to 48 hours before travel. Contact our group sales department at groups@saturnairlines.com or 1-800-SATURN-GROUP for personalized assistance.

CHECK-IN PROCEDURES

Online Check-In
Online check-in opens 24 hours before your scheduled departure time and closes 60 minutes before domestic flights and 90 minutes before international flights. You can check in through our website or mobile app using your confirmation number or frequent flyer account. During online check-in, you can select or change your seat (subject to availability and fare restrictions), add checked baggage, purchase upgrades, and receive your mobile boarding pass. Mobile boarding passes can be saved to your phone's wallet app for easy access at the airport.

Airport Check-In
If you prefer to check in at the airport, you can use our self-service kiosks or visit the check-in counter. Self-service kiosks are available in all terminals and allow you to print boarding passes, add checked bags, and make seat changes. Full-service counters are staffed by our customer service agents who can assist with special requests, unaccompanied minors, passengers with disabilities, and other needs. Check-in counters open 3 hours before departure and close 45 minutes before domestic flights and 60 minutes before international flights.

Required Documentation
For domestic flights within the United States, passengers 18 and older must present a valid government-issued photo ID such as a driver's license, passport, or state-issued ID card. Passengers under 18 traveling with an adult do not need ID, but unaccompanied minors require specific documentation. For international flights, a valid passport is required, and many destinations require visas. It is the passenger's responsibility to ensure they have all required travel documents. We recommend checking entry requirements for your destination country at least 30 days before travel.

BAGGAGE POLICIES

Carry-On Baggage Allowance
All passengers are permitted one personal item (purse, laptop bag, or small backpack) that must fit under the seat in front of you, and one carry-on bag that must fit in the overhead bin. Maximum dimensions for carry-on bags are 22 x 14 x 9 inches, including handles and wheels. The maximum weight is 40 pounds. Personal items must not exceed 18 x 14 x 8 inches. Items that exceed these dimensions will need to be checked and standard checked baggage fees will apply. Priority boarding passengers and elite frequent flyer members may board early to ensure overhead bin space availability.

Checked Baggage Allowance and Fees
Checked baggage fees vary by fare type and route. Basic Economy fares do not include checked baggage, and the first checked bag costs $35 for domestic flights and $50 for international flights. Standard Economy includes one free checked bag (up to 50 pounds and 62 linear inches), with the second bag costing $45 domestic and $65 international. Flex Economy and Premium Economy include two free checked bags. Business Class includes three free checked bags. Additional bags beyond the allowance cost $150 each. Overweight bags (51-70 pounds) incur a $100 fee, and oversized bags (63-80 linear inches) cost $200. Bags over 70 pounds or 80 linear inches cannot be accepted as checked baggage.

Special and Oversized Items
Sports equipment such as golf clubs, skis, snowboards, and bicycles can be checked for a fee of $75 per item, subject to size and weight restrictions. Musical instruments can be carried on if they fit in overhead bins or under seats, or checked for standard baggage fees. Large instruments may require purchasing an additional seat. Medical equipment, mobility devices, and assistive devices travel free of charge and do not count toward baggage allowances. Firearms must be declared and packed according to TSA regulations. Contact our special services team at least 48 hours before travel for assistance with special items.

Baggage Claims and Lost Items
If your checked baggage is delayed or lost, report it immediately at the baggage service office in the arrival terminal. We will provide you with a file reference number and begin tracking your bag. Delayed bags are typically delivered to your address within 24-48 hours at no charge. For lost baggage claims, we will reimburse reasonable expenses for essential items purchased while your bag is missing, up to $50 per day for up to 5 days. If your bag is not located within 21 days, it will be declared lost and you may file a claim for compensation up to $3,500 for domestic flights and international limits as per the Montreal Convention.

FLIGHT CHANGES AND CANCELLATIONS

How to Edit or Modify Your Flight Reservation
You can modify your flight reservation through multiple channels: online through your account on our website or mobile app, by calling our reservations center, or by visiting an airport customer service counter. To make changes online, log into your Saturn Airlines account, navigate to "My Trips," select your reservation, and click "Modify Flight." You can change your flight date, time, route, seat selection, add services, or update passenger information. Changes can be made up to 24 hours before your scheduled departure time for most fare types. For changes within 24 hours of departure, you must call our reservations center or visit the airport. All changes are subject to fare rules, availability, and applicable fees. You will receive a new confirmation email with updated flight details after making changes.

Change Policies by Fare Type
Change policies vary significantly by fare type. Basic Economy tickets are non-refundable and non-changeable, except in cases of flight cancellations or significant schedule changes made by the airline (defined as schedule changes of more than 90 minutes, routing changes, or aircraft type changes that affect your seat assignment). Standard Economy tickets can be changed for a fee of $200 per person per change, plus any fare difference if the new flight is more expensive. If the new flight is less expensive, you will receive a travel credit for the difference, valid for one year. Changes must be made at least 24 hours before the original departure time. Flex Economy tickets allow unlimited free changes up to 24 hours before departure, with only fare differences applying. If you change to a less expensive flight, the difference will be refunded to your original form of payment. Premium Economy and Business Class tickets include free changes and cancellations, with full refunds available up to 24 hours before departure. All fare types allow changes to be made up to one year from the original booking date, subject to availability.

Changing Flight Dates and Times
When changing your flight date or time, you can select any available flight on the same route within 330 days of your original booking date. Date changes maintain your original fare class when possible, but if your original fare class is not available on the new date, you may need to pay the fare difference or accept a different fare class. Time changes to flights on the same date are subject to the same change fees and policies as date changes. You can view available alternative flights during the change process and compare prices before confirming. If you need to change to a date more than 330 days in the future, you must cancel your original booking and make a new reservation. Changes to international flights may require additional time for visa and documentation verification.

Changing Flight Routes and Destinations
Route changes (changing your origin or destination city) are treated as a cancellation and rebooking, which means you will be charged change fees plus any fare difference. Basic Economy tickets cannot be changed to different routes. Standard Economy route changes cost $200 per person plus the full fare difference. Flex Economy, Premium Economy, and Business Class tickets allow route changes with only the fare difference applying. When changing routes, you must select a new flight within 330 days of your original booking. If you change to a less expensive route, the difference will be issued as a travel credit (Standard Economy) or refunded (Flex Economy and above). Route changes may affect your baggage allowance, seat assignments, and special services, so review all details before confirming.

Name Changes and Corrections
Minor name corrections (typos, spelling errors, or legal name changes due to marriage) can be made free of charge up to 24 hours before departure. To request a name correction, contact our reservations center with your confirmation number and provide documentation if the correction is substantial (such as a marriage certificate or court order). Name corrections must match the name on your government-issued ID exactly. You cannot transfer your ticket to another person - if someone else will be traveling, you must cancel your booking (subject to cancellation fees) and they must purchase a new ticket. Name changes for award tickets follow the same policies, with a $150 processing fee for name corrections on award bookings.

Multiple Passenger Reservations
When multiple passengers are booked on the same reservation, change and cancellation policies apply per person. You can change individual passengers' flights while keeping others on the original itinerary, but this may result in the reservation being split into separate bookings. If one passenger cancels, the remaining passengers' tickets are not automatically adjusted - you must contact us to ensure the reservation is properly maintained. Group bookings (10+ passengers) have different change policies and may require coordination through our group sales department. When making changes to multi-passenger reservations, all passengers' eligibility for the change will be verified, and fees will be calculated per person.

Cancellation and Refund Policies
Cancellation policies mirror change policies but have some important distinctions. Basic Economy tickets are non-refundable except when Saturn Airlines cancels the flight, makes significant schedule changes (more than 90 minutes), or in cases of documented medical emergencies or death in the immediate family (with proper documentation). Standard Economy tickets can be cancelled for a $200 fee per person, with the remaining value (original fare minus the $200 fee) issued as a travel credit valid for one year from the date of cancellation. Travel credits can be used by the original passenger for any future Saturn Airlines flight and can be applied during booking by entering the credit voucher number. Flex Economy, Premium Economy, and Business Class tickets are fully refundable to the original form of payment when cancelled more than 24 hours before departure. Cancellations made within 24 hours of departure follow the same policies but may take longer to process. Partial cancellations (cancelling some passengers from a group reservation) are allowed, with fees and credits calculated per person.

Travel Credits and Vouchers
Travel credits are issued when you cancel a non-refundable ticket or when you change to a less expensive flight. Credits are issued as electronic vouchers with a unique confirmation code and are valid for one year from the date of issue (not from the original booking date). Travel credits can be used to book any Saturn Airlines flight and can be combined with other forms of payment if the new booking exceeds the credit amount. Credits cannot be transferred to another person and must be used by the original passenger. You can check your credit balance and expiration date by logging into your account or calling reservations. If you don't use your credit before it expires, the value is forfeited. Credits from cancelled award tickets result in miles being redeposited to your account rather than a monetary credit.

Refund Processing and Timelines
Refunds for eligible cancellations are processed automatically when you cancel online or through our call center. Credit card refunds are processed within 7-10 business days, though it may take an additional 3-5 business days for the refund to appear on your statement depending on your bank. Debit card refunds take 10-14 business days. PayPal refunds are processed within 5-7 business days. Bank transfers and wire transfers take 14-21 business days. Refunds are issued to the original form of payment used for the booking. If your original payment method is no longer valid (expired card, closed account), contact our refunds department to arrange an alternative payment method. Partial refunds (when changing to a less expensive flight) follow the same processing timelines. You will receive email confirmation when your refund is processed, and you can track refund status in your account.

Emergency Cancellations and Special Circumstances
In cases of documented emergencies such as serious illness, death in the immediate family, natural disasters affecting your home or destination, or military deployment orders, we may waive change and cancellation fees. To request a fee waiver, contact our customer service team and provide appropriate documentation (doctor's note, death certificate, official evacuation notice, or military orders). Fee waivers are evaluated on a case-by-case basis and are not guaranteed. Even with a fee waiver, fare differences may still apply if you rebook to a more expensive flight. Travel insurance may provide additional coverage for emergencies, so check your policy if you purchased travel insurance. In cases where Saturn Airlines cancels your flight or makes significant changes, all fees are automatically waived and you are entitled to a full refund or rebooking at no additional cost.

No-Show Policies
If you do not show up for your flight and have not cancelled or changed your reservation in advance, you are considered a "no-show." Basic Economy and Standard Economy tickets are forfeited with no refund or credit issued for no-shows. Flex Economy tickets can be cancelled after the flight departure for a $200 fee, with the remaining value issued as a travel credit. Premium Economy and Business Class tickets retain their value as travel credits even if you no-show, but you must contact us within 24 hours of the scheduled departure to process the credit. If you miss a connecting flight due to a delay on a Saturn Airlines flight, we will automatically rebook you on the next available flight at no charge. If you miss a flight due to circumstances beyond your control (such as a delayed incoming flight on another airline), contact our customer service immediately - we may be able to assist with rebooking, though policies vary by situation.

Same-Day Changes and Standby
Same-day confirmed changes are available for a fee of $75 when seats are available in the same fare class on flights departing the same day. You can change to an earlier or later flight on your original route. Same-day changes must be requested at least 60 minutes before your original flight's departure time and can be made online, through the app, by phone, or at the airport. Same-day standby allows you to be placed on a waitlist for an earlier flight on the same day and route. Standby is free for elite frequent flyer members (Silver, Gold, and Platinum) and costs $50 for other passengers. Standby passengers are confirmed in order of elite status tier, then by check-in time. You can check standby status through our app or at the gate. Same-day changes and standby are only available for flights on the same day as your original booking and on the same route. International flights are not eligible for same-day changes or standby due to customs and immigration requirements, advance passenger information requirements, and visa restrictions.

Weather and Operational Cancellations
When Saturn Airlines cancels a flight due to weather, mechanical issues, crew scheduling problems, or other operational reasons, affected passengers are entitled to rebooking on the next available flight at no additional charge, regardless of fare type. We will automatically rebook you on the next available flight and notify you via email, text message, or phone call. You can also proactively rebook yourself through our website, app, or by calling reservations. If the cancellation results in a delay of more than 4 hours, passengers may be eligible for meal vouchers (for delays over 4 hours) and hotel accommodations (for overnight delays or cancellations that require an overnight stay). Hotel accommodations are provided at airport hotels or nearby properties and include ground transportation. Passengers may also request a full refund to the original form of payment if they choose not to travel, regardless of their original fare type. We recommend signing up for flight status alerts to receive real-time notifications about delays and cancellations. In cases of widespread weather disruptions affecting multiple flights, we may issue travel waivers that allow free changes or cancellations for flights to affected areas, even if your specific flight hasn't been cancelled yet.

Schedule Changes and Aircraft Changes
If Saturn Airlines changes your flight schedule by more than 90 minutes, changes your routing, or changes your aircraft type in a way that affects your seat assignment or service level, you are entitled to a free change or full refund, regardless of your fare type. You will be notified of significant schedule changes via email and can choose to accept the new schedule, change to a different flight, or cancel for a full refund. Minor schedule changes (less than 90 minutes) do not qualify for fee waivers, but you can still make changes subject to normal change fees and policies. If you were assigned a specific seat and the aircraft change results in a different seat configuration, we will attempt to assign you a comparable seat, but specific seat assignments are not guaranteed. Premium cabin downgrades due to aircraft changes entitle you to a refund of the fare difference.

Modifying Add-On Services
You can add, modify, or remove add-on services such as checked baggage, seat assignments, travel insurance, and in-flight Wi-Fi at any time before check-in. Adding services incurs the standard fees for those services. Removing services that were purchased separately will result in a refund to your original form of payment, processed within 7-10 business days. Services included with your fare class (such as free checked bags with Premium Economy) cannot be refunded if you downgrade your fare, but you can upgrade your fare to include additional services. Special services such as unaccompanied minor service, pet travel, or wheelchair assistance can be added or modified by contacting our special services department. Changes to special services may require 48 hours' notice depending on the service type.

CONNECTING FLIGHTS AND LAYOVERS

Minimum Connection Times
Minimum connection times vary by airport and whether you're connecting domestically or internationally. For domestic-to-domestic connections at most airports, the minimum connection time is 45 minutes. For domestic-to-international connections, the minimum is 60 minutes. For international-to-domestic connections, the minimum is 90 minutes to allow for customs and immigration clearance. For international-to-international connections, the minimum is 60 minutes, but may be longer depending on whether you need to change terminals or clear customs. When booking connecting flights through Saturn Airlines, our system automatically ensures your connection meets minimum time requirements. If you book separate tickets on different airlines, you are responsible for ensuring adequate connection time. We recommend allowing at least 2 hours for international connections when booking separate tickets to account for potential delays and customs processing.

What Happens If You Miss Your Connection
If you miss your connecting flight due to a delay or cancellation on your inbound Saturn Airlines flight, we will automatically rebook you on the next available flight to your destination at no additional charge, regardless of your fare type. You will be notified of your new flight details via email, text message, or at the gate. If the next available flight is the following day, we will provide hotel accommodations and meal vouchers. If you miss your connection due to a delay on another airline (when you've booked separate tickets), we will attempt to rebook you on the next available Saturn Airlines flight, but you may be charged a change fee and fare difference depending on your fare type. If you miss your connection due to your own actions (arriving late to the airport, missing your first flight, etc.), you will be treated as a no-show and standard change fees and policies will apply. Always check with a gate agent or customer service representative immediately if you're concerned about making your connection.

Baggage on Connecting Flights
When all flights in your itinerary are on Saturn Airlines or our codeshare partners, your checked baggage will be automatically transferred to your connecting flight. You do not need to collect and recheck your bags during connections. Simply claim your bags at your final destination. If you have a connection that involves different airlines (non-codeshare partners) or if you're connecting from an international flight to a domestic flight, you may need to collect your bags, clear customs, and recheck them. Our check-in agents will inform you if you need to collect your bags during a connection. For international connections, you must clear customs and immigration at your first point of entry into a country, even if your final destination is elsewhere. Carry-on baggage remains with you throughout your journey, so you're responsible for transporting it between gates during connections.

Terminal and Airport Changes
Some airports require you to change terminals or even airports during connections. When booking through Saturn Airlines, we will inform you if a terminal change is required. At most airports, terminal changes can be made via walkways, shuttles, or trains within the secure area, so you won't need to exit and re-enter security. However, some connections may require exiting security and re-entering, which means you'll need to allow extra time and go through security screening again. If you're connecting between different airports (such as JFK to LGA in New York), you are responsible for ground transportation and must allow significant additional time - we recommend at least 4-5 hours for airport-to-airport connections. These types of connections are generally not recommended, and we will notify you if your booking includes such a connection. Always verify your connection airport and terminal before traveling.

International Connections and Customs
When connecting through an international airport, you must clear customs and immigration at your first point of entry into that country, even if you're continuing to another destination. For example, if you're flying from Los Angeles to London with a connection in New York, and your New York to London flight is international, you'll clear U.S. customs in New York. If you're flying from London to Los Angeles with a connection in New York, you'll clear U.S. customs and immigration in New York before continuing to Los Angeles. Allow extra time for international connections to account for customs processing, which can take 30 minutes to 2 hours depending on the airport and time of day. You may need to collect your checked baggage, clear customs, and recheck it before continuing. Our check-in agents will provide specific instructions for your itinerary. Ensure you have all required travel documents (passport, visas) ready for customs clearance.

Short Layovers and Tight Connections
If you have a short layover (less than 90 minutes for domestic or 2 hours for international), we recommend moving quickly between gates and being prepared. Check your gate assignment as soon as you land, as gates can change. Use airport maps and signage to find the most direct route to your connecting gate. If you're concerned about making a tight connection, inform a flight attendant on your inbound flight, and they may be able to arrange assistance or notify the connecting gate. If you have elite status or are in a premium cabin, you may have access to priority security lanes or expedited customs processing that can help with tight connections. If you're running late, go directly to your connecting gate rather than stopping for food or restroom breaks. Gate agents can hold flights for a few minutes if you're in transit, but only if you're already in the airport and en route to the gate.

Long Layovers and Overnight Connections
For layovers longer than 4 hours, you may want to leave the airport to explore the city, but be aware of visa requirements and allow sufficient time to return and clear security. For overnight connections (layovers longer than 8 hours or connections that require an overnight stay), Saturn Airlines will provide hotel accommodations if the connection is due to our schedule or if we've cancelled or significantly delayed your inbound flight. If you've booked an overnight connection by choice, you're responsible for your own accommodations. Many airports have transit hotels or lounges where you can rest during long layovers. Airport lounges are available to Business Class passengers, elite frequent flyer members, and can be purchased for day access. Some airports offer sleeping pods, showers, and other amenities for long layover passengers. Check airport websites for available services and amenities.

Connecting Flight Rebooking
If your inbound flight is delayed and you're at risk of missing your connection, we will proactively rebook you on alternative flights. You'll receive notification of your new flight details via email, text, or the Saturn Airlines app. You can also check your updated itinerary online or at any airport kiosk. If you prefer a different connection option, contact our customer service team or visit a customer service counter. When rebooking due to a missed connection, we will place you on the next available flight, but you can request specific alternatives if available. If the delay causes you to miss the last flight of the day, we will provide hotel accommodations and rebook you for the next day. Your checked baggage will be automatically rerouted to your new flight. If you've already checked in for your original connection, your new boarding pass will be available at the gate or customer service counter.

Codeshare and Partner Airline Connections
When connecting between Saturn Airlines and partner airlines (codeshare flights), your baggage will typically be checked through to your final destination, and you'll receive boarding passes for all segments at initial check-in. However, policies vary by partner, so confirm baggage transfer at check-in. You may need to change terminals or even airports for some partner connections. Check-in requirements and minimum connection times may differ for partner airline connections. If you miss a connection on a partner airline due to a Saturn Airlines delay, we will work with the partner to rebook you, but policies and procedures may vary. Elite status benefits may apply on partner airlines, but specific benefits depend on the partnership agreement. Always verify connection details and requirements when traveling on mixed-airline itineraries.

SPECIAL SERVICES AND ACCOMMODATIONS

Passengers with Disabilities
Saturn Airlines is committed to providing accessible travel for all passengers. We offer wheelchair assistance at no charge, both for boarding and deplaning. Passengers with mobility devices can check wheelchairs and scooters free of charge, and these items do not count toward baggage allowances. Service animals are welcome in the cabin at no charge with proper documentation. Passengers with hearing or vision impairments can request special assistance, and our staff is trained in disability awareness. We recommend contacting our special services department at least 48 hours before travel to arrange accommodations. Our aircraft are equipped with accessible lavatories, and we can provide assistance with meals and in-flight services.

Unaccompanied Minors
Children ages 5-11 traveling alone must use our unaccompanied minor service, which costs $150 each way. Children 12-17 may travel alone but can also use the unaccompanied minor service for an additional fee if parents prefer. The service includes dedicated check-in assistance, priority boarding, supervision during connections, and handoff to authorized adults at the destination. Unaccompanied minors can only travel on non-stop flights or flights with connections where they do not need to change terminals. Parents or guardians must remain at the airport until the flight departs and authorized adults must arrive at the destination airport at least 30 minutes before arrival. Required documentation includes birth certificates, consent forms, and contact information for all parties.

Pet Travel Policies
Small dogs and cats can travel in the cabin for a fee of $125 per pet, per flight segment. Pets must be at least 8 weeks old, fit in an approved carrier under the seat, and remain in the carrier for the entire flight. Only one pet per passenger is allowed, and pets count as the passenger's carry-on item. Larger pets must travel as checked baggage in an approved kennel for $200 per pet, per flight segment. Pets traveling as checked baggage are subject to temperature restrictions and cannot travel if ground temperatures are below 20°F or above 85°F at any point in the journey. Service animals travel free of charge with proper documentation. All pets require health certificates issued within 10 days of travel. Contact our reservations team to add a pet to your booking, as space is limited.

Medical and Special Dietary Needs
Passengers with medical conditions requiring special accommodations should contact our medical services team at least 48 hours before travel. We can accommodate passengers requiring oxygen, medical equipment, or special seating arrangements. Passengers with severe allergies should notify us in advance, and we can provide buffer zones and special meal accommodations. We offer a variety of special meals including vegetarian, vegan, kosher, halal, gluten-free, diabetic, and low-sodium options. Special meals must be requested at least 24 hours before departure and are available in all fare classes. Passengers with medical conditions that may affect their ability to travel should consult with their physician and may need to provide medical clearance forms.

TRAVEL REQUIREMENTS AND DOCUMENTATION

Passport and Visa Requirements
For international travel, all passengers must have a valid passport. Passports must be valid for at least 6 months beyond your return date for most destinations. Some countries require visas for U.S. citizens, while others offer visa-free entry or visa-on-arrival. It is the passenger's responsibility to obtain all required visas before travel. We recommend checking entry requirements for your destination at least 30 days before departure. Our website provides links to government resources, but requirements can change, so verify directly with the destination country's embassy or consulate. Non-U.S. citizens traveling to the United States must have valid visas or be eligible for the Visa Waiver Program.

TSA PreCheck and Global Entry
TSA PreCheck allows eligible passengers to use expedited security screening at U.S. airports. Members keep their shoes, belts, and light jackets on, and laptops and liquids can remain in carry-on bags. TSA PreCheck membership costs $78 for 5 years and is available to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents. Global Entry provides expedited customs clearance for international travelers and includes TSA PreCheck benefits. Global Entry costs $100 for 5 years. Saturn Airlines frequent flyer members can add their Known Traveler Number to their profile to automatically receive TSA PreCheck benefits on eligible bookings. Not all passengers on a reservation will receive TSA PreCheck benefits unless all are members.

Travel Insurance
Saturn Airlines offers optional travel insurance through our partner, TravelGuard, which provides coverage for trip cancellation, trip interruption, medical emergencies, baggage loss, and travel delays. Insurance can be purchased during booking or up to 24 hours after booking. Coverage varies by plan, with basic plans starting at $29 per trip and comprehensive plans available for international travel. We recommend travel insurance for international trips, expensive bookings, or when traveling during peak seasons. Travel insurance is separate from our change and cancellation policies and provides additional protection for unforeseen circumstances. Review policy details carefully, as coverage exclusions apply.

IN-FLIGHT SERVICES

Entertainment and Connectivity

SEAT UPGRADES

How to Upgrade Your Seat
You can upgrade your seat through multiple channels: during booking, after booking through "My Trips" on our website or app, at check-in, or at the airport. To upgrade online, log into your account, select your reservation, and click "Upgrade Seat." You'll see available upgrade options with pricing. Upgrades can be purchased using cash, miles, or a combination of both. Upgrade availability is limited and varies by flight, so we recommend upgrading as early as possible. You can also request upgrades at the airport check-in counter or gate, subject to availability. Last-minute upgrades are often available at discounted rates if premium cabins have empty seats. Elite frequent flyer members may be eligible for complimentary upgrades based on their status tier and availability.

Upgrade Options and Pricing
Upgrade pricing varies by route, flight duration, and availability. Economy to Premium Economy upgrades typically cost $150-400 for domestic flights and $300-800 for international flights, depending on the route and demand. Economy to Business Class upgrades range from $400-1,200 for domestic flights and $800-3,000 for international flights. Premium Economy to Business Class upgrades cost $200-600 for domestic and $500-1,500 for international. Upgrade prices are dynamic and may change based on seat availability and demand. Shorter flights generally have lower upgrade prices, while long-haul international routes command premium pricing. Upgrade prices are displayed in real-time when you view your reservation, and you can compare cash and mileage upgrade options.

Mileage Upgrades
You can use Saturn Rewards miles to upgrade your seat instead of paying cash. Mileage upgrade requirements vary by route and fare class. Economy to Premium Economy upgrades typically require 15,000-30,000 miles for domestic flights and 25,000-50,000 miles for international flights. Economy to Business Class upgrades require 30,000-75,000 miles for domestic and 60,000-150,000 miles for international routes. Premium Economy to Business Class upgrades require 15,000-40,000 miles for domestic and 30,000-80,000 miles for international. Mileage upgrades are subject to availability and must be requested at least 24 hours before departure. You can combine miles and cash for upgrades if you don't have enough miles. Award tickets can also be upgraded using additional miles, with requirements varying by the original award level.

Complimentary Upgrades for Elite Members
Elite frequent flyer members are eligible for complimentary upgrades based on availability and status tier. Platinum members receive the highest priority for complimentary upgrades to Premium Economy and Business Class, followed by Gold members, then Silver members. Complimentary upgrades are processed automatically starting 72 hours before departure for Platinum members, 48 hours for Gold members, and 24 hours for Silver members. Upgrade priority is based on elite status tier, then by fare class purchased, then by check-in time. Complimentary upgrades are not guaranteed and depend on seat availability. You'll be notified via email or the app if you receive a complimentary upgrade. To maximize your chances, book higher fare classes (Flex Economy or above) and check in early. Complimentary upgrades are available on most domestic and select international routes.

Instant Upgrades at Booking
When booking a flight, you may see instant upgrade offers that allow you to upgrade immediately at a discounted rate. These offers are available when premium cabins have confirmed availability and are often priced lower than post-booking upgrades. Instant upgrade offers are displayed during the booking process, and you can add the upgrade to your reservation before completing payment. Instant upgrades are non-refundable but can be changed subject to the same policies as your underlying ticket. If you cancel your flight, the upgrade value may be retained as a credit depending on your fare type. Instant upgrade offers are time-limited and may disappear if seats are booked by other passengers, so we recommend securing them during booking if interested.

Last-Minute and Gate Upgrades
Last-minute upgrades are often available at the airport check-in counter or gate at discounted rates. These upgrades are offered when premium cabins have unsold seats close to departure. Last-minute upgrade pricing is typically 30-50% lower than advance purchase upgrades. Availability is not guaranteed and varies by flight. You can inquire about last-minute upgrades at check-in counters or ask gate agents when you arrive at your gate. Payment can be made with cash, credit card, or miles. Last-minute upgrades are final and non-refundable. If you're interested in a last-minute upgrade, arrive early and check with agents, as these upgrades are sold on a first-come, first-served basis. Elite members may receive last-minute complimentary upgrades if available after all paid upgrades have been processed.

Upgrade Eligibility and Restrictions
Not all fare types are eligible for upgrades. Basic Economy tickets cannot be upgraded with cash or miles, though elite members may receive complimentary upgrades on Basic Economy tickets in rare cases. Standard Economy, Flex Economy, Premium Economy, and Business Class tickets are all upgradeable. Award tickets can be upgraded using additional miles. Upgrades are subject to seat availability and cannot be guaranteed until confirmed. Some routes may not offer upgrade options if premium cabins are not available on the aircraft type. International upgrades may have additional restrictions based on visa requirements or fare rules. Upgrades purchased with miles are subject to award availability, which may differ from cash upgrade availability. Group bookings may have limited upgrade availability.

Upgrade Changes and Cancellations
If you need to change or cancel an upgrade, policies depend on how the upgrade was purchased. Cash upgrades follow the same change and cancellation policies as your underlying ticket. If you change your flight, your upgrade will transfer to the new flight if the same fare class and route are available, or you'll receive a credit for the upgrade value. Mileage upgrades can be cancelled with miles redeposited to your account, subject to a $50 processing fee if cancelled within 24 hours of departure. Complimentary upgrades are automatically cancelled if you change or cancel your flight. If you're downgraded due to an aircraft change or operational issue, you'll receive a refund of any upgrade fees paid or miles used. Upgrade credits are valid for one year from the date of issue.

Bid for Upgrade Program
Saturn Airlines offers a "Bid for Upgrade" program on select flights, allowing you to submit a bid for a seat upgrade. You'll receive an email invitation 7 days before your flight if you're eligible. You can bid any amount you choose, and we'll notify you 24-48 hours before departure if your bid is accepted. Bids are processed based on the amount offered and availability. If your bid is accepted, your payment method will be charged, and you'll receive your upgraded seat assignment. If your bid is not accepted, no charge is made. You can modify or cancel your bid up to 24 hours before departure. The Bid for Upgrade program is available on routes with Business Class and Premium Economy cabins. Minimum bid amounts vary by route and are displayed when you submit your bid. This program provides an opportunity to upgrade at potentially lower prices than standard upgrade rates.

Upgrade Benefits and Amenities
Upgrading your seat provides access to enhanced amenities and services. Premium Economy upgrades include extra legroom (34-36 inches of pitch), wider seats, priority boarding, enhanced meal service, complimentary alcoholic beverages, and priority baggage handling. Business Class upgrades provide lie-flat seats on select routes, premium dining with chef-curated menus, premium beverage service including wine and spirits, priority check-in and security screening, airport lounge access, priority boarding, and enhanced baggage allowance. Upgrade benefits begin at the airport and continue throughout your journey. All upgrades include the amenities associated with the upgraded cabin class, regardless of your original fare type. Upgraded passengers receive the same service level as passengers who originally booked the premium cabin.

OPERATIONAL INFORMATION

Fleet and Aircraft
Saturn Airlines operates a modern, fuel-efficient fleet consisting primarily of Boeing 737 MAX 8 and MAX 9 aircraft for domestic and short-haul international routes, Airbus A320neo aircraft for high-density routes, and regional jets operated by our partner carriers for smaller markets. Our fleet averages 5 years in age, making it one of the youngest in the industry. All aircraft are equipped with modern safety systems, Wi-Fi connectivity, and personal entertainment systems. We continuously invest in fleet modernization and have orders for additional fuel-efficient aircraft to support our growth and environmental goals.

On-Time Performance
Saturn Airlines maintains one of the best on-time performance records in the industry, with 87% of flights arriving within 15 minutes of scheduled time over the past year. We define on-time performance as flights arriving at the gate within 15 minutes of the scheduled arrival time. Factors affecting on-time performance include weather, air traffic control delays, and operational issues. We invest in predictive analytics and operational improvements to minimize delays. When delays occur, we work to minimize passenger inconvenience through proactive communication, rebooking assistance, and compensation when appropriate.

Safety and Security
Safety is our highest priority at Saturn Airlines. All our pilots undergo rigorous training and recurrent certification, and our maintenance programs exceed FAA requirements. We have a perfect safety record with zero fatal accidents in our 25-year history. Our security measures comply with all TSA and international aviation security regulations. We work closely with government agencies to ensure the safety and security of all passengers and crew. Passengers are required to comply with all security screening procedures, and prohibited items are strictly enforced. Our aircraft undergo regular safety inspections and maintenance, and we have comprehensive emergency response procedures in place.

Environmental Initiatives
Saturn Airlines is committed to environmental responsibility and sustainability. We have invested over $2 billion in fuel-efficient aircraft, reducing our carbon emissions per passenger by 25% since 2015. Our goal is to achieve carbon neutrality by 2035 through a combination of fleet modernization, sustainable aviation fuels, operational efficiencies, and carbon offset programs. We offer passengers the option to purchase carbon offsets when booking flights. We have eliminated single-use plastics from our in-flight service and recycle all recyclable materials. Our corporate headquarters operates on 100% renewable energy, and we support reforestation and conservation projects in the communities we serve.

PARTNERSHIPS AND ALLIANCES

Airline Partnerships
Saturn Airlines has codeshare agreements with several international carriers, allowing passengers to book connecting flights on partner airlines with a single reservation. Our primary partners include airlines in Europe, Asia, and South America. Codeshare flights earn Saturn Rewards miles and count toward elite status qualification. We also have interline agreements with additional carriers for baggage transfer and through-check-in services. Partner airline benefits vary, so check specific terms when booking codeshare flights. Elite status members receive reciprocal benefits on select partner airlines, including lounge access and priority services.

Hotel and Car Rental Partners
Saturn Rewards members can earn miles for stays at over 5,000 hotels worldwide through our hotel partners, including major chains and boutique properties. Hotel stays typically earn 2-5 miles per dollar spent, depending on the property and booking channel. We also partner with major car rental companies, offering discounted rates and the ability to earn miles on rentals. Car rental bookings can be made through our website or by calling reservations. Some hotel and car rental partners offer additional benefits to Saturn Rewards elite status members, such as room upgrades, late checkout, and rental car upgrades.

MISCELLANEOUS POLICIES

Age Restrictions and Policies
Infants under 2 years old can travel on an adult's lap for free on domestic flights (10% of adult fare on international flights) or in their own seat with a child fare. Children 2-11 years old pay child fares, which are typically 75% of adult fares. Unaccompanied minors aged 5-11 must use our unaccompanied minor service. Passengers 12-17 can travel alone but may use the service if desired. There is no maximum age restriction for travel, though passengers with medical conditions may need physician clearance. Senior discounts are available for passengers 65 and older on select routes and fare types.

Traveling with Infants and Children
Infants traveling on laps do not receive a separate seat or baggage allowance. Car seats and strollers can be checked free of charge and do not count toward baggage limits. Car seats can also be used in purchased seats if they are FAA-approved. Changing tables are available in most aircraft lavatories. We provide infant meals and can warm bottles upon request. Children's meals can be requested with 24-hour notice. Priority boarding is available for families with young children to allow extra time for settling in. Bassinets are available on select long-haul international flights for infants under 2 years old and 20 pounds.

Prohibited Items and Restrictions
The TSA and international security agencies prohibit certain items in both carry-on and checked baggage. Prohibited items include weapons, explosives, flammable materials, and certain liquids over 3.4 ounces. Liquids in carry-on bags must be in containers of 3.4 ounces or less and placed in a clear quart-sized bag. Medications, baby formula, and medically necessary liquids are exempt from the 3.4-ounce rule but must be declared at security. Lithium batteries have specific restrictions, and spare batteries must be in carry-on baggage. Sharp objects, tools, and sporting equipment have specific rules. Check our website or TSA.gov for complete lists of prohibited and restricted items.

Traveling During Holidays and Peak Seasons
Holiday and peak season travel requires advance planning. We recommend booking holiday flights at least 60-90 days in advance for the best prices and availability. Popular travel periods include Thanksgiving week, Christmas and New Year's, spring break, and summer vacation months. During peak seasons, flights are often full, so flexibility with dates and times can help secure bookings. Consider traveling on off-peak days (Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays) for better availability and lower fares. Airport parking fills up quickly during holidays, so consider alternative transportation or reserve parking in advance. Allow extra time for check-in and security during busy travel periods.
